# Pythonsec
Learning Python as applicable for use in security testing.
Original script was found here http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/port-scanner-in-python
The changes found here are based on helpful comments from the above page and also my own changes to the original script.
Changes made:
- Minor changes to text strings describing what the script is doing.
- Changed to allow you to specify start port and end port.
- Changed to display a list of ports which are closed.
